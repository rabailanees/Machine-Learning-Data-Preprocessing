# Machine Learning Data Preprocessing

## Overview

This repository contains a series of **Jupyter Notebooks** that cover essential **data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** techniques for machine learning projects. The notebooks are organized by different data preparation tasks, from univariate and multivariate analysis to encoding categorical variables and feature scaling. It also includes practical examples of **web scraping**, **fetching data from APIs**, and creating custom datasets.

## Notebooks Included

- **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**: Techniques for exploring relationships between multiple variables.
- **Disney Dataset Creation**: Example of generating a custom dataset for machine learning projects.
- **Encoding Categorical Data**: Methods for converting categorical variables into numerical form.
- **Feature Scaling - Normalization**: Rescaling features to a standard range.
- **Feature Scaling - Standardization**: Standardizing features to have zero mean and unit variance.
- **Fetching Data from an API**: A practical example of retrieving data from a web API.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into a binary vector format.
- **Understanding Your Data**: Initial data exploration to understand the datasetâ€™s structure and patterns.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual features and their distributions.
- **Web Scraping**: Scraping data from websites for analysis.
